### Q1: Tell me about a coding project that you worked on. What language did you use and what did it do

So my last work experience is on Alibaba group, and I was asked to build a application for the finical department. So alibaba has the largest e-commerce website in china and our finical department is working on calculating the tax. They are using the microsoft excel and they generated too much offline data. My job is to build the springboot application using java and receive thousands of different types of excels. I applied easyexcel api and also generate goorvy scipt to read different formats into json, and stored json data into mysql database, finally deployed the application to the distributed cloud system. The main language i used was java.

### Q2: Tell me about how you learn new technology. Use an example of when you had to learn a new language or framework.

To learn a new language or framework, i would always like to dive deep into the technique. Because if you do not dive into the technique that you will use, it is very possible that you cannot debug when your appliaction goes wrong. To have a better understanding on the technology cannot be a waste of time. Go throgh the offical documentation will always be my first choice, because even reading other articles may be faster, the offical document will always be the one that is the most accurate.

### Q3: What technology and tools do you use when writing code? We want to hear about operating systems, editors, debuggers, and anything else that helps you be efficient and productive

I used git a lot when i'm writing code. So git is firstly a version control tool, using git can make debugging easy for you, and you can easily go back to the old version. And unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. This ensures that the master branch always contains production-quality code.

Git can give you faster release cycle, this facilitates an [agile workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/workflow) where developers are encouraged to share smaller changes more frequently. So as a teamwork member, git can help us be more efficient and productive

### Q4: 有人挑你刺怎么办

So when someone blames on me, i would like to firstly check myself whether I was doing something wrong. It's alwasy important to learn and be humble, asking for advice directly could also be great to earn trust. If I still cannot solve the problem, I would like to ask for leader's help, I believe that leaders are right alot and can do the right decision.

### Q5: So tell me, why nordstrom

I like shopping a lot, but however, the user experience of online cloth shopping is still not perfect, so I would like to contribute to the improvement of it. And nordstrom has been working to deliver the best possible shopping experience, helping customers express their styles. I believe join nordstrom can bring customers with the best experience on online fashion shopping.

### Q6: 为什么适合

I’m a hard-working graduate student from Boston University majored in Computer Engineering. During several internship experience in huge companies like Alibaba Group, who has the largest e-commerce website in china, I gained valuable skills on full-stack engineering and big data platform. Also, I’m familiar with Java and python while have deep comprehension in algorithm. With my positive attitude and experience, I’m capable of writing efficient codes in team work and responding fast in tight deadline. The e-commerce experience also make me suitable for this job.
